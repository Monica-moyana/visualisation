# Student Exam Performance
## by Khaya Monica Moyana


## Dataset

This dataset is found on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/spscientist/students-performance-in-exams). It includes scores from three exams and a variety of personal, social, and economic factors that have interaction effects upon them. It is made up of 1000 rows and 8 kaggle

## Summary of Findings

I will convey my summary by answering the following questions.
>How effective is the test preparation course?

Students who took the test prepartion course were most likely to pass their exams. This was tested by plotting a graph that checks the aggregate score against students who took the preparation course. out of interest, i also looked at the number of students who took the preparation course based on their parents level of education. I found that their parents level of education has no influence on them taking the course. They took the test based solely by choice.

>Which major factors contribute to test outcomes?

It was found that taking standard lunch alone or taking the preparatory course alone produces excellent results.Having both lunch and the preparation course was even more effective. Students whose race is group E mostly excelled in their exams but this wasn't enough to conclude that belonging to group E gurantees success as they are minority. Gender seems to have no effect on the students exams scores as the difference between male and females is not that major

>What would be the best way to improve student scores on each test?

The best way to improve student scores is if they take the test prepartion course and also eat healthy lunch to boost their dopamine levels


## Key Insights for Presentation

For my presentation i will only focus on factors that provided us with clear conlusions which is:
1.Performance of students by gender- this will be shown by a violin plot
2.Effects of taking lunch befere the exam
3.Effects of taking the test preparation course
4.Change in aggregate score as a factor of lunch and test preparation course
